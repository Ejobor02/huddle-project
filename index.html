        <h2>Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h2>
        <p>
          Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice,
          but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you
          engage in genuine discussion.

        <p>
          You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it
          online? Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural
          flow.

          It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's
          authentication solution. This means, once signed in to your app,
          your users can start chatting immediately.
